# Data

Data used in the repeatability code is stored here. We utilize data generated from several sources in the repeatability package. An explanation of the data sets are provided here.

## Linearized Cart-Pole

The linearized cart-pole data is generated using a system description in
[NNV](https://github.com/verivital/nnv) with a neural network controller.

## Nonlinear Cart-Pole

The nonlinear cart-pole data is generated using a system description in
[NNV](https://github.com/verivital/nnv) with a neural network controller.
