# Algorithm Implementations

In this folder, we include minimal algorithm implementations for the two
algorithms, `KernelEmbeddings` and `KernelEmbeddingsRFF`. These implementations
are _not_ used in the repeatability code, and are included for documentation
purposes only.

Please see the full implementations in
[SReachTools](https://sreachtools.github.io) for more information, examples of
their use, and performance benchmarks.
